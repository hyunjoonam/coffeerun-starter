Please tackle these high level goals:

Create a section of the website that will hold a list of all orders that were submitted
When the user submits the form, add the new coffee order to the list
When the user hits the reset button, clear out the form
Some stretch goals:

Make coffee orders delete-able
Keep a list of all orders submitted in localStorage (You can store an array in localStorage as a string by using JSON.stringify(myCoffeeOrdersArray); )
If you can succesfully do that ^^, then make the list of saved coffee orders render when the page first loads
Update the list of orders on the screen and in localStorage each time the user submits the form.
Advice:

Do break your code up into functions + global variables. (think about what your state and actions are)
Do try to move "hard-coded" values into variables/constants. (For example, if you keep typing the same selector string over and over, that's a good sign that you should create a global variable.)
Try writing a "renderOrders()" function that will show the list of orders to the screen based on your global state variables
